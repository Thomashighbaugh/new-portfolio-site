# Resurgens 2: The JS Edition
Resurgens 2 Portfolio Site Clone

## Introduction 

_Resurgens_ - Latin term meaning rebirth. 

This README.md is associated with the Resurgens series of sites, several related incarnations of my portfolio site that all should have some, possibly non-functional, incarnation available for viewing thanks to the free hosting provided by Netlify! Each version of the site that exists at present is intended to convey fluency in HTML5 and CSS3, and some versions will add additional languages, frameworks and paradigms onto that base competency. The primary version of the site is hosted [here](http://tlh-resurgens.com).

## Version 2 Features
Version 2 was crafted with JS adding the "flavor" of the design. While not intended to be as a React app and merely a div on the index file with numerous modules being called in JSX to populate the DOM, this site demonstrates core competency and creativity regarding the utilization of ES5 in a site that also pays specific attention to the responsiveness of the site to the varied devices present in the modern business environment as well as maintaining compliance with accessibility standards that are the law of the land, and rightfully so. The JS featured mainly helps populate, and hide, the information on the "back" of the sectional cards.

Another feature of the second incarnation of Resurgens is that it is a one page site, as there is need to split my design and development work into separate portions that may relate and inform the other but do not crowd a single domain (especially with 6500 pictures now incorpated in my graphic design portfolio). Thus I went to the standard signle page layout, despite personal misgivings about the above the fold rule being flaunted. In designing this site, I overcame the need to be skeptical about the use of the header space, by using modals and JS to animate those modals. This way I have a responsive, well ordered and single page site compromising on no principles of design other than need for dark themes do to the hours I spend in front of the screen working on the site being well into the evening.

## Version 3 Prospectius 

Either the next incarnation will be a static React based site for demonstrative purposes or it will be a more completely vanilla JS site, simply to show further competency. It will address the following needs...

### _Version 3_ Wishlist

- demonstrate knowledge of React Framework or ES6/ES7
- Include additional neon noir aesthetical references as the first site 
- Utilize responsiveness to create a mobile optimized UX at those screen sizes and a desktop intuitive UX at larger sizes 
- Intuitively Interface with Design Portfolio & Behance 
- Custom Graphics
