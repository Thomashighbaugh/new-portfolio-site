<!--This is the Resurgens Portfolio V 2.001
The reimagining of the original portfolio available through a link which will be within the ReadME as its design is still a major example of my design prowess
Nonetheless the impetus for the redesign is to showcase both my adherence to the buzzwords within in web development (static, one page and including some JS functionality)
The use of modals to take the place of pages is not quite what React Router can do but it is a foreshadowing of the third version of the site which is forthcoming. -->

            <h3>V2.1.11.18 </h3>
            <p>This is the second incarnation of the Resurgens Portfolio Site. The site you are now looking at is an improvement over the last in
            two ways, that it is responsive and that is made with JS. While the last site is still being hosted, it is made solely with HTML/CSS to demonstrate proficiency with those baselines.
            However this site uses JS functionality and much more thorough commentary. The former provides evidence of competence in JS while V3.x is being made with react components. </p>
            <h4>Content</h4>
            <p>This site derives much of its content from what has already been written and some of that is unpublished content, content I would have included were it not for the lack of space in the V1.x series</p>
            <p>If you seek additional content I am providing resumes or can be reached via email (see last card)</p>

			<h3>Software Development & Programming Languages Skills </h3>
            <h4> HTML5/CSS3</h4>
            <p>As this description follows the chronological introduction I have had to various technologies, I am now returning to languages used in software development. HTML 5 and CSS 3 are used in
                conjunction with one another so thoroughly that it is not useful to separate them from one another in this context. This skill set is probably the only one I am more comfortable with than
                even Linux as it is one that I mastered since devoting myself completely to tech, which began about 2 years ago and has remained consistent ever since. While not terribly complex languages
                to learn, their mastery does take either a significant dive into the subject independently and avoiding the tendency that many have of learning pieces of them in conjunction with JS as
                doing so leaves too much of the underlying logic unsaid.</p>
               <p> I have also received a Front End Certificate that took a significant dive into these tandem languages, JS, libraries of JS and APIs that helped to deepen my
            appreciation for the use of these languages in practice and one class I am in currently is on them specifically. While not requiring the sheer technical know-how or analytical capacity of JS,
            they speak to another skill set I bring with me (but will not presently discuss ad nasesum) which is design and thus creative capacity of a more detailed depth than imagining if pushing and
            popping elements out of an array will accomplish the task as there is little easily articulated in the creative with the words present in the English lexicon. Being recent, I do have **some** of
            the decent examples of my endeavors of these languages posted on any of my 3 VC accounts (Bitbucket, GitLab, GitHub) but being a one man development team mastering React, I don't at present
            have the time to go through and edit them all for placement in the public and personally don't release low-quality code to the public due to quirks of my character.</p>
            <h4>Javascript ES05 // JQuery // Bootstrap // Vue</h4>
            <p>Javascript, which is also sometimes called JS, vanilla JS etc,  is the scripting language that emerged from NetScape and took over the internet. As with anyone in tech today,
                I could not avoid JS if I hope to be a useful memeber of any modern technology development outfit for the client side rendering that this language enables is such that the browser can
                perform some of the compute tasks that would otherwise have been done on a server thus leveraging user systems to lower overhead and infrastructure complexity. I also happen to like
                JS as a programming language simply because it is a scripting language and demonstrates it in ways that are more apparent to me to be descendant from the BASH Shell.</p>
